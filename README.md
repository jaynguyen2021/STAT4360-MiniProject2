## Overview

This project explores two datasets using regression and classification techniques to understand prediction accuracy, model selection, and bias‚Äìvariance tradeoff.

1. **Wine Quality Analysis**  
   - Built multiple linear regression models to predict wine *Quality* using features such as *Clarity, Aroma, Body, Flavor, Oakiness,* and *Region*.  
   - Selected the reduced model:
     \[
     \hat{Quality} = 7.0943 + 1.1155 \times Flavor - 1.5335 \times Region_2 + 1.2234 \times Region_3
     \]
   - \( R^2 = 0.82 \), showing strong positive correlation between *Flavor* and *Quality*.  
   - Diagnostic plots confirmed normal residuals and stable variance.

2. **Diabetes Classification**  
   - Compared **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** and **Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)**.  
   - Results summary:

     | Model | Misclassification | Sensitivity | Specificity | AUC |
     |--------|------------------|--------------|--------------|-----|
     | LDA | 22.0% | 56.4% | 89.2% | 0.837 |
     | QDA | 23.6% | 57.6% | 86.2% | 0.835 |

   - Chosen model: **LDA** (simpler and slightly higher accuracy).

3. **Bonus ‚Äì James‚ÄìStein Estimator Simulation**  
   - Compared **James‚ÄìStein** vs **MLE** estimators for multivariate normal means.  
   - Findings: James‚ÄìStein has lower risk (MSE) due to bias‚Äìvariance tradeoff when \( p \ge 3 \).
